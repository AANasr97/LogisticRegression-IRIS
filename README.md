# Iris Multiclass Classification Project

Welcome to the Iris Multiclass Classification project! In this project, we explore the famous Iris flower dataset and build a multi-class logistic regression model for classification tasks. This README provides an overview of the project and its key components.

## About the Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 and contains measurements of three different species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

For more information about the Iris dataset, you can visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

## Project Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the first part of the project, we perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset. We explore its structure, statistics, and visualizations to better understand the characteristics of the iris flowers.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Before building the classification model, we preprocess the data. This includes splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and scaling the features to ensure that the model performs optimally.

### 3. Multi-Class Logistic Regression Model

The core of the project involves building a multi-class logistic regression model using the scikit-learn library. We train the model on the training data and tune its hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Visualizations are provided to help interpret the results.

### 5. Evaluating Curves and AUC

To assess the model's performance further, we visualize Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for multi-class classification.
